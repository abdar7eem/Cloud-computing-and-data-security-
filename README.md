# Cloud-computing-and-data-security-
The purpose of this project is to propose a secure migration plan for TechSolutions Inc., a mid-sized technology company, to move its on-premises IT infrastructure to the cloud. The main goal is to improve scalability, accessibility, and cost-effectiveness while addressing significant security concerns related to data protection and vulnerabilities during cloud adoption. The project aims to identify key security risks associated with cloud computing, particularly data breaches, and propose appropriate countermeasures to ensure data security, privacy, and integrity in the cloud environment. This involves evaluating cloud computing models, security measures, and formulating a robust strategy to mitigate vulnerabilities.

The solution proposes migrating TechSolutions Inc. to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), focusing on leveraging GCP's services like IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS to meet the company's goals of scalability, cost-efficiency, and accessibility. Security risks, including data breaches, are addressed through GCPâ€™s security features such as data encryption, DDoS protection, and Identity and Access Management (IAM). Techniques used include defining a shared responsibility model, where GCP manages the physical and network security while the client is responsible for user authentication and data/application security. The proposal incorporates data classification, lifecycle management, and cloud-native security tools like Key Management Service (KMS) and Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP), ensuring privacy, confidentiality, and integrity of the company's sensitive data.
